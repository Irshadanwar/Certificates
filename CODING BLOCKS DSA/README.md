# ðŸŒŸ Completion of Data Structures and Algorithms Course  

I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of an immersive classroom course on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JAVA**, conducted by **Coding Blocks** under the exceptional guidance of **Monu Kumar Bhaiya**.  

During this journey, I solved nearly **200 problems** in DSA, mastering a wide range of fundamental topics in computer science and programming. This accomplishment is a testament to the skills and knowledge I gained throughout the course.
